Our lab aims to understand how cellular behavior emerges from the dynamics and structural organization of biomolecules. A key characteristic of many subcellular structures is their ability to maintain structural integrity while responding rapidly to external stimuli. For instance, a cell’s nucleus can retain a stable genomic structure while simultaneously reorganizing chromosome configuration in response to external signals. Our goal is to uncover the mechanisms behind this phenomenon through the concept of metastability—a state characterized by multiple stable configurations that allow for rapid transitions between them. To achieve this, we use a combination of microfabricated cell mechanics devices and advanced optical microscopy techniques, such as lattice light sheet microscopy and single-molecule imaging. We also explore the role of machine learning in facilitating our research.

The cytoskeleton network consists of cross-linked biopolymers and protein motors that exert non-thermal forces. It plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including migration, mitosis, and immune responses. Notably, the actomyosin network exhibits striking similarities to soft glassy materials, such as power-law rheology, non-Gaussian fluctuations, and step-like displacement events (cytoquakes), indicating that it is in a marginally stable state. By combining micropost array detectors with single-molecule imaging, we investigate the structural organization, dynamics, and mechanical responses of the cytoskeleton to uncover the biophysical origins of its metastability.

With any perturbation to activity or experience, the probability that a neural circuit will undergo plasticity is state-dependent.  For instance, the capacity for plasticity tends to decline with age, lending support to the concept of critical periods.  We develop neural interfaces and control architectures for precisely regulating spiking to create activity states that support plasticity at the cellular, synaptic, and circuit levels.

Amblyopia is a widespread neurodevelopmental visual impairment that arises from maladaptive plasticity during infancy or early childhood.  We aim to develop novel therapeutics for amblyopia that leverage our knowledge of plasticity at different ages and disease severities.  Treatment strategies range from neuroprosthetic implants that directly stimulate the brain to minimally invasive manipulations to visual experience or behavior.
