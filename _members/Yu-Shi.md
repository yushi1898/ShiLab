Yu Shi is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Western University. He obtained his Bachelor's in Physics at the University of Science and Technology of China and completed his Ph.D. in Physics at Johns Hopkins University where he studied dynamical fluctuations in cytoskeleton. He then continued his academic career as a postdoc at UNC at Chapel Hill working on advanced optical microscopy. His research interests lie in understanding the connection between microscopic interactions and macroscopic emerging phenomena in subcellular structures, specifically within the cytoskeleton and nuclear architectures. He is also interested in developing and implementing relevant mechanical and imaging tools to study cellular biophysics.
