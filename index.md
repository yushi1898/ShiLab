# Reveal the missing link
Our lab seeks to understand how macroscopic cell behaviors arise from the microscopic interactions of polymer building blocks. To address this question, we aim to investigate cellular structure, dynamics, and mechanics across multiple length scales simultaneously. We leverage cutting-edge tools in biomechanics and advanced optical microscopy, and we are also interested in applying machine learning to enhance our research.
<br>We are recruiting motivated graduate students. Prior experience in one or more of the following will be helpful: coding in Python or Matlab, microscopy, image analysis, active matter physics, machine learning, optics, mechanobiology or single molecule imagingy.
