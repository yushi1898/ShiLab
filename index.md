# Reveal the missing link
The BIO-MAS lab seeks to understand how macroscopic cell behaviors arise from the microscopic interactions of polymer building blocks. To address this question, we aim to investigate cellular structure, dynamics, and mechanics across multiple length scales simultaneously. We leverage cutting-edge tools in biomechanics and advanced optical microscopy, and we are also interested in applying machine learning to enhance our research.

<br>Our lab is part of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Western University. We invite students, postdoctoral researchers, and collaborative scientists who are interested in exploring new technologies and methods or applying these tools to tackle fundamental questions in cell biophysics.
